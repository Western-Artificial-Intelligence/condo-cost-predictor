 🏙️ Toronto Condo Affordability Predictor

A spatio-temporal machine learning system that predicts neighborhood-level condo prices and helps users plan down payments based on income and savings

---

## 📘 Overview

Housing affordability is a major challenge for students and young adults in Toronto.  
This project uses open municipal and federal datasets to:

1. **Predict condo prices** across Toronto neighborhoods using machine learning (LightGBM/XGBoost).  
2. **Estimate affordability timelines** for users based on their income and savings rate.  
3. **Visualize attainable neighborhoods** through an interactive web application.
