## Branch Naming Convention
Use clear, scoped branch names based on your role and task:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Data | `data/<short-description>` | `data/etl-pipeline` |
| ML | `ml/<short-description>` | `ml/baseline-model` |
| Backend | `backend/<short-description>` | `backend/fastapi-setup` |
| Frontend | `frontend/<short-description>` | `frontend/ui-layout` |
| Docs | `docs/<short-description>` | `docs/sprint1-summary` |
| Fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/frontend-api-call` |

Create a new branch before working on any issue:
```bash
git checkout -b backend/fastapi-setup

## making your branch 
# make sure you're on main and up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Now create a new branch from the latest main
git checkout -b settings/contrubutionformat
git add .
git commit -m "Add contribution format and setup"
git push --set-upstream origin settings/contrubutionformat


# SINCE I ALREADY SET UP THE ISSUES USE THIS FORMAT 
#<type>: <short summary> (#issue-number)

# DO NOTTTT PUSH INTO MAINN! MUST PR. 

# chek what you are committing git status
